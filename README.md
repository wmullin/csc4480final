# csc4480final
The code in this repository is for the CSC 4480 Final Project.
The idea is a SQL database of a restaurant, modified for the current Coronavirus crisis.
Originally the database represented tables at a restaurant where waiters would take an order and give it to the chef to make.
Now I have replaced the waiters with delievries to the customers house and replaced tables with orders for food.
The three files should be simple enough, once you run the scripts for the schema and data you can run the queries.
